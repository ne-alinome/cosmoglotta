- Convert constrained bold markup.
- Convert "\\'" -> "'".
- Adapt asterisks used to mark footnotes.
- Convert escaped ellipsis. 
- Check remaining escaped asterisks.
- Fix ellipsis without trailing space.
- Delete duplicated article "STENOGRAFIE E INTERLINGUE".
- Fix splitted numbers: use hard spaces.
- Fix paragraphs divided by images or their descriptions.
- Fix ellipsis with leading space: Keep the trailing space if it's an
  actual ellipsis in a quote.
- Expand abbreviations of "Cosmoglotta": Cgl, Cossm, Cgl.-Inf.,
  Cgl-Inf, Cgl-Informationes.
- Convert Mediawiki's "'''".
- Remove dots and other punctuation at the end of section titles.
- Add a block markup before the blocks following the content lists
  which are at the end of the issues. These last sections generally
  contain news about new books.
- Remove the original content lists. It looks they are not accurate
  (sometimes they are incomplete, the titles are different than the
  actual ones, or are in a different order), and their format is
  heterogeneous. Besides, they are useless in a digital book, because
  the TOC is built out of the actual headings. Preserving the original
  content lists an converting into links would be too much work for no
  gain.
- Confirm: "Neredith" or "Meredith" Knox Gardner. Also used "M.K.
  Gardner".
- Check the original verbatim marks `****`: they are a type of
  Asciidoctor block markups.
- Convert remaining footnotes.
- Comment out and mark notes about missing images.
- Fix remaining symbols that are used as abbreviatures (km and m are
  already fixed).
- Homogenize the format of article authors' names: Move them to their
  own paragraph.
- Markup subsections of "Cronica", e.g. lands.
- Homogenize headings in lowercase.
- Make footnotes about the new headings.
- Replace the deprecated `footnoteref` macro with `footnote` and a
  target.
- Homogenize the format of the APIS new addresses: dashes, language
  abbreviations, etc.
- Convert all of the old abbreviatons of language names, e.g.
  "A.F.G.Esp.". Use their full names in Interlingue, separated by
  commas.
- Fix OCR errors, e.g. "0" instead of "o".
- Homogenize format of the original TOC items, e.g. dots.
- Remove surrounding spaces in quotes.
- Fix orientation of French quotes.
- Move punctuation outside the quotes, e.g. "«aaa,»" -> "«aaa»,".
- Convert long quotes at the end of a paragraph into quotes blocks,
  e.g. "bla bla: «...»".
- Fix spacing before "%".
